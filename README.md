# Software-Design-2018-Melp

As a team, recreated a version of Yelp using Java and a GUI for our final project. Implemented the use of various design strategies, such as command and state patterns to allow for detailed functionality to mimic the functions of Yelp as closely as possible. Users can create a profile, log in, write/read a review, block other users, etc.

Created various JUnit tests and incorporated Test Driven Development throughout the development of the application.
